Web Scraping
============

Sites
------

See ``scraping`` directory. For now, these are mostly in Jupyter notebooks and may require some future cleanup, but for the time being the notebooks are available for the following sites:


- CS Vape
- Get Pop
- My Vapor Store
- Perfect Vape
- Vape.com
- Vape Sourcing
- Vape WH
- Vaping.com

Some of the original regular expression functions developed as a demo are available here, but we expect them to all eventually be replaced and/or migrated to the NLP code section.
