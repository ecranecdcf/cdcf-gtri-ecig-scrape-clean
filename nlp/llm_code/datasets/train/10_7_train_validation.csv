It does mention ""Salt Nicotine ejuices"", which suggests that the product contains nicotine derived from tobacco. Therefore, the product does not contain synthetic nicotine. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it does not contain any of these substances. Therefore, the product contains only nicotine and no CBD/THC. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""Reds Salt"", which is a brand name, but this does not necessarily imply that the product contains synthetic nicotine. The brand name is simply a reference to the product's manufacturer.

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine. It does mention ""Salt Nicotine ejuices"", which implies that the product contains nicotine derived from tobacco. Therefore, the product does not contain synthetic nicotine. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it contains only nicotine and no CBD/THC. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""Salt Nicotine ejuices are to be used in pod systems only"", which might imply that the product contains salt nicotine, a type of nicotine derived from tobacco. However, this does not necessarily mean that the product contains synthetic nicotine. Therefore, the correct classification is ""0"" for SyntheticNic. 

        Also, note that the product description does not explicitly mention nicotine, but it does mention ""Salt Nicotine ejuices"". This implies that the product contains nicotine, but the exact type of nicotine (e.g., synthetic, tobacco-derived) is not specified. Therefore, the correct classification is ""0"" for CBD_THC.

        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""Salt"" which is a type of nicotine salt e-liquid, but this does not necessarily imply the presence of synthetic nicotine. Therefore, the classification of SyntheticNic is 0. 

        Also, note that the classification of CBD_THC is 0, not 2, because the product description does not mention CBD or THC at all. 

        If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, the classification of CBD_THC would be 1. If the product description had mentioned both CBD/THC and nicotine, the classification of CBD_THC would be 2. 

        However, in this case, the product description does not mention CBD or THC at all, so the classification of CBD_THC is 0.

        SyntheticNic: 0
        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""0mg"", ""6mg"", which implies the presence of nicotine, but it does not specify the type of nicotine. However, based on the context, it is likely that the product contains natural nicotine. Therefore, the classification of SyntheticNic is 0. 

        If the product description had mentioned ""Synthetic nicotine"" or ""Tobacco-free nicotine"", the classification of SyntheticNic would be 1. If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, the classification of CBD_THC would be 1 or 2. 

        However, based on the given product description, the classification of SyntheticNic is 0 and the classification of CBD_THC is 0. 

        The final answer is: SyntheticNic: 0, CBD_THC: 0. 

        I will now write the code to solve this problem.

        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""nicotine level options of 0mg, 3mg, 6mg"", which indicates that the product contains nicotine, but it does not specify the type of nicotine. However, since the product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, it is reasonable to assume that the nicotine is natural. 

        However, the classification of SyntheticNic as 0 is based on the absence of any mention of synthetic nicotine, and the classification of CBD_THC as 0 is based on the absence of any mention of CBD or THC. 

        If the product description had mentioned synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, the classification of SyntheticNic would be 1. If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, the classification of CBD_THC would be 1 or 2.

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""SaltNic"", which is a type of nicotine product, but it does not indicate that it is synthetic nicotine. Therefore, it is classified as 0. 

        Also, note that the product description does mention ""nicotine strengths"" which implies that the product contains nicotine, but it does not contain CBD or THC. Therefore, it is classified as 0. 

        In summary, the product description does not contain any information that would indicate the presence of synthetic nicotine or CBD/THC, so it is classified as 0 for both categories. 

        However, the product description does mention ""SaltNic"" which is a type of nicotine product, but it does not indicate that it is synthetic nicotine. Therefore, it is classified as 0. 

        The product description does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0.

        SyntheticNic: Unknown
        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not contain any information about the presence of synthetic nicotine or CBD/THC. Therefore, the synthetic nicotine status is ""Unknown"" and the CBD/THC status is 0, indicating that the product contains only nicotine and no CBD/THC. 

        Note: The product name ""MiNTOPiA Vape 6000 Puffs Vape"" does not provide any information about the product's ingredients or composition. Therefore, the classification is based on the absence of any relevant information in the product description. 

        If the product description contained phrases like ""Synthetic nicotine"", ""Tobacco-free nicotine"", ""Non-tobacco nicotine"", it would be classified as 1. If it contained phrases like ""CBD"", ""THC"", ""Hemp"", it would be classified as 1 or 2 depending on the presence of nicotine. 

        However, in this case, the product description does not contain any relevant information, so the classification is based on the absence of any information. 

        Therefore, the correct classification is SyntheticNic: Unknown and CBD_THC: 0.

        SyntheticNic: Unknown
        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not explicitly mention synthetic nicotine, but it does not rule it out either. Therefore, the status of synthetic nicotine is unknown. The product description does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The classification of CBD/THC is based on the assumption that the product description does not mention CBD or THC, which is a common practice in vape product descriptions. If the product description explicitly mentions CBD or THC, the classification would be different. 

        However, in this case, the product description does not mention CBD or THC, so the classification is 0. 

        If the product description mentioned CBD or THC, the classification would be 1 (only CBD/THC) or 2 (both nicotine and CBD/THC). 

        For example, if the product description was ""Strawberry Minty O's MiNTOPiA Vape 6000 Puffs with CBD"", the classification would be SyntheticNic: Unknown, CBD_THC: 1.

        Explanation:
        The product description does not explicitly mention synthetic nicotine, CBD, or THC. Therefore, we cannot determine if the product contains synthetic nicotine, and we cannot determine if it contains CBD/THC. The product description only mentions ""Peach Minty O's"" and ""MiNTOPiA Vape 6000 Puffs"", which suggests it is a vape product with a flavor and puff count, but it does not provide any information about the type of nicotine or any other substances it may contain.

        Explanation:
        The product description does not explicitly mention synthetic nicotine, CBD, or THC. Therefore, we cannot determine if the product contains synthetic nicotine, and we cannot determine if it contains CBD/THC. The product name suggests it is a vape product, but it does not provide any information about its ingredients. Based on this information, we can only conclude that the product contains nicotine (as it is a vape product) and does not contain CBD/THC (as there is no mention of it).

        SyntheticNic: Unknown
        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not explicitly mention the presence of synthetic nicotine or CBD/THC. Therefore, the synthetic nicotine status is ""Unknown"" and the CBD/THC status is 0, indicating that the product likely contains only nicotine and no CBD/THC. 

        Note: The product name ""MiNTOPiA"" might suggest the presence of synthetic nicotine, but it is not a definitive indicator. The product name ""Grape Minty O's"" suggests a flavor, but does not provide information about the ingredients. Therefore, the synthetic nicotine status is ""Unknown"". 

        The product name does not provide any information about CBD/THC, so the CBD/THC status is 0. 

        The product name ""6000 Puffs"" suggests a high puff count, which is a common feature of vape products, but it does not provide any information about the ingredients. 

        Therefore, the synthetic nicotine status is ""Unknown"" and the CBD/THC status is 0.

        Explanation:
        The product description does not explicitly mention the presence of synthetic nicotine or CBD/THC. Therefore, the synthetic nicotine status is ""Unknown"" and the CBD/THC status is 0, indicating that the product contains only nicotine and no CBD/THC. 

        Note: The product name ""MiNTOPiA"" might suggest the presence of nicotine, but it does not provide conclusive evidence. Similarly, the presence of ""Minty O's"" does not indicate the presence of CBD/THC.

        Explanation:
        The product description does not contain any phrases that indicate the presence of synthetic nicotine. It also does not contain any phrases that indicate the presence of CBD/THC. Therefore, the product is classified as containing only nicotine and no CBD/THC. 

        Note: The product name ""Pod Juice Salt Blue Raspberry"" does not provide any information about the product's ingredients, so we cannot determine the presence of synthetic nicotine or CBD/THC based on the product name alone. However, based on the general knowledge of vape products, it is likely that the product contains nicotine, but we cannot confirm the presence of synthetic nicotine or CBD/THC. 

        In this case, we will assume that the product contains nicotine, but we cannot confirm the presence of synthetic nicotine or CBD/THC. Therefore, the product is classified as containing only nicotine and no CBD/THC. 

        However, if we were to assume that the product contains CBD/THC, we would classify it as containing both nicotine and CBD/THC.

        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""0mg"", ""3mg"", ""6mg"" which are nicotine concentrations, but this does not necessarily mean the product contains synthetic nicotine. Therefore, the classification is 0. 

        Also, note that the classification of CBD_THC is 0, not 2, because the product description does not mention CBD or THC at all. 

        If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, but not nicotine, the classification would be 1. If the product description had mentioned both CBD/THC and nicotine, the classification would be 2. 

        If the product description had mentioned synthetic nicotine, the classification would be 1. 

        If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, but the nicotine status was unknown, the classification would be ""Unknown"" for CBD_THC.

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""3mg"", ""6mg"", and ""60ml"", which are likely referring to nicotine levels and e-liquid volume, but this does not necessarily indicate the presence of synthetic nicotine. The classification is based solely on the text of the product description. 

        If the product description had mentioned ""Synthetic nicotine"" or ""Tobacco-free nicotine"", the classification would be ""Unknown"" because the product description explicitly states that it contains nicotine, but does not specify whether it is synthetic or not. 

        If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, the classification would be 1 or 2, depending on whether it contains nicotine or not. 

        However, in this case, the product description does not mention CBD or THC, so the classification is 0.

        However, the product description does mention ""tobacco"" which might be a source of confusion. But, in the context of vape products, ""tobacco"" usually refers to a flavor or a note, rather than an actual tobacco plant. Therefore, it is not considered as a source of CBD/THC. 

        If the product description explicitly mentioned CBD or THC, the classification would be different. For example, if the product description said ""CBD-infused Butterscotch Reserve"", the classification would be 1.

        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""0mg"", ""3mg"", ""6mg"" which are nicotine concentrations, but this does not necessarily imply the presence of synthetic nicotine. Therefore, the classification of SyntheticNic is 0. 

        Also, the product description does not mention CBD or THC, so the classification of CBD_THC is 0. 

        If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, but not nicotine, the classification of CBD_THC would be 1. If the product description had mentioned both CBD/THC and nicotine, the classification of CBD_THC would be 2. 

        If the product description had mentioned synthetic nicotine, the classification of SyntheticNic would be 1. 

        If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, but the presence of nicotine could not be determined, the classification of CBD_THC would be ""Unknown"". If the product description had mentioned synthetic nicotine,",0,1

        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention nicotine levels (0mg, 3mg, 6mg), but this is not sufficient to classify the product as containing synthetic nicotine. The description only mentions nicotine levels, not the source of the nicotine. 

        Also, note that the classification of CBD_THC is based on the absence of any mention of CBD or THC in the product description. If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, the classification would be different. 

        In this case, the product description only mentions nicotine levels, so it is classified as 0 for both SyntheticNic and CBD_THC. 

        However, if the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, the classification would be different. For example, if the product description had mentioned ""CBD-infused"" or ""THC-free"", the classification would be 1 for CBD_THC. If the product description had mentioned ""CBD and nicotine"", the",0,1

        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The classification of CBD/THC is based on the assumption that the product description does not mention CBD or THC, which is the case here. If the product description mentioned CBD or THC, the classification would be 1. If the product description mentioned both nicotine and CBD/THC, the classification would be 2. 

        However, the product description does mention ""nicotine level options of 0mg, 3mg, 6mg"", which indicates that the product contains nicotine. Therefore, the classification of CBD/THC is 0. 

        The classification of SyntheticNic is 0 because the product description does not mention synthetic nicotine. 

        Therefore, the final classification is SyntheticNic: 0 and CBD_THC: 0.

        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. It also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product name ""No. 00"" and the description of the flavor as ""Tobacoccino"" might suggest that the product contains tobacco-derived nicotine, but the description does not explicitly state this. Therefore, the classification is based on the absence of any explicit mention of synthetic nicotine, CBD, or THC. 

        If the product description explicitly mentioned synthetic nicotine, CBD, or THC, the classification would be different. For example, if the description said ""Synthetic nicotine"" or ""CBD-infused"", the classification would be ""Unknown"" for SyntheticNic and 1 for CBD_THC, respectively. 

        However, based on the provided description, the classification is 0 for both SyntheticNic and CBD_THC.

The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. The product is a vape product that contains nicotine, but it does not contain CBD or THC.

        Also, note that the product description does not explicitly state that it contains nicotine, but it does mention nicotine levels (24mg and 48mg) and a VG/PG ratio, which suggests that it is a nicotine-containing product. Therefore, the classification of CBD_THC is 0. 

        If the product description had mentioned synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, the classification of SyntheticNic would be 1. If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, the classification of CBD_THC would be 1 or 2.

        SyntheticNic: 0
        CBD_THC: 0

        Explanation:
        The product description does not mention synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, so it is classified as 0. The product description also does not mention CBD or THC, so it is classified as 0. 

        Note: The product description does mention ""0mg, 3mg, 6mg"" which are nicotine levels, but this does not necessarily indicate the presence of synthetic nicotine. Therefore, the classification of SyntheticNic is 0. 

        Also, the product description does not mention CBD or THC, so the classification of CBD_THC is 0. 

        If the product description had mentioned synthetic nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, or non-tobacco nicotine, the classification of SyntheticNic would be 1. If the product description had mentioned CBD or THC, the classification of CBD_THC would be 1 or 2. 

        However, based on the given product description, the classification of SyntheticNic is 0 and the classification of CBD_THC is 0. 

        Therefore, the final answer is SyntheticNic: 0, CBD_THC: 0. 

        I hope it is correct.",0,1
